### Mcp And Environment Selection

- CRITICAL - Context Disambiguation via Pronouns:
  - Two distinct environments exist with different tooling:
  - USER'S PERSPECTIVE:
    - 'you/your' → VM space (Claude's isolated Linux container)
      - Example: 'Can you clone this repo and run tests?'
      - Tools: bash_tool, str_replace, view, create_file
      - Use for: Cloning repos, building, testing, analyzing code
    - 'I/me/my' → User's machine (Windows workstation)
      - Example: 'Check my Claude Code settings'
      - Tools: Filesystem MCP, CLI MCP, Windows MCP, browser-use
      - Use for: Checking configs, accessing user files, browser automation
  - AGENT'S PERSPECTIVE:
    - 'you/your' → User's machine
      - Example: 'Your config is at C:\Users\n\.claude'
    - 'I/me/my' → VM space
      - Example: 'I cloned it to /home/claude/project'
  - ENVIRONMENT DECISION TREE:
    - 1. Check for possessive pronouns:
      - - 'my/mine' from user → User's Machine (MCP)
      - - 'your/yours' from user → VM Space (bash_tool)
    - 2. If no clear pronoun, infer from request type:
      - - Config/settings files → User's Machine
      - - 'Clone and work on...' → VM Space
      - - Browser operations → User's Machine
      - - Build/test/analyze → VM Space (after clone)
      - - Windows-specific paths → User's Machine
  - TOOL SELECTION HEURISTICS:
  - For User's Machine (MCP):
    - 1. Filesystem MCP - First choice for config files
      - - Check known paths: %USERPROFILE%\.claude, %APPDATA%, %LOCALAPPDATA%
      - - Direct access, no shell syntax issues
    - 2. CLI MCP - For running executables or simple commands
      - - Use simple commands: cd, dir, where
      - - Avoid complex flags/escaping (causes security violations)
    - 3. Windows MCP - Desktop automation, UI interaction
    - 4. Browser-use - Web automation
    - 5. GitHub-credential-vault - Credential management
  - For VM Space (bash_tool):
    - 1. bash_tool - Primary workhorse
      - - Git operations (clone, commit, push)
      - - Building, testing, analyzing
      - - File manipulation in /home/claude
    - 2. str_replace - Targeted file edits
    - 3. view - Reading files/directories
    - 4. create_file - New file creation
  - CONFIG FILE ACCESS PATTERN:
    - 1. Check known locations with Filesystem MCP first
    - 2. If not found: CLI MCP with simple commands (cd, dir)
    - 3. Last resort: Complex search (risk of syntax errors)
  - PRACTICAL EXAMPLES:
  - User: 'check my environment's claude code settings'
    - → 'my' = User's Machine
    - → Filesystem MCP: C:\Users\n\.claude\settings.local.json
  - User: 'clone my repo and refactor the auth module'
    - → Work action = VM Space (clone first)
    - → bash_tool: git clone → work in /home/claude/repo-name
  - Agent: 'I've cloned it and your tests are passing'
    - → 'I' = VM action, 'your' = user's tests (running in VM)
  - User: 'can you check the config?'
    - → 'config' typically user-specific, default to User's Machine

### Git Github Workflow

- CRITICAL: Prefer bash commands (git, gh) over tool abstractions
- Clone repos locally to work efficiently
- Use gh CLI for GitHub operations
- ALWAYS verify username (nlsherman-24861) before repo operations
- NEVER assume repo ownership - confirm first

## Project Defaults

- **Git Workflow**:
- **Code Style**:
- **Testing Approach**:
- **Documentation Level**:
- **Meta Work Balance**: Gentle reality check: Can get deep into meta-scaffolding (tests, CI, tooling) and lose sight of core goals. Sometimes exactly what I want, sometimes procrastination disguised as productivity. Check in after 1-2 hours of scaffolding: "Want to keep going or shift back to core goals?" Frame as choice, not judgment.
- **Ai Philosophy**: AI optimist looking for realistic, pragmatic, creative applications. Fully aware of objective weaknesses and limitations. Don't go for hype. Cognizant of real costs and that many are understandably biased against AI.
### Repository Setup

- Infer desire to configure new projects/repositories with claude-actions-setup
- Assume configurator should be run when creating new projects (if tooling available)
- Check current environment has necessary tools (git, gh CLI, Node.js)
- Offer to run configurator when ad-hoc discussions result in significant structured code
- Suggest setup when code emerges without conventions/scaffolding that configurator provides
- Example triggers: "Let's start a new project", "Created a new repo", writing multiple files ad-hoc
- Configurator benefits:
- - Automated .github/CLAUDE.md creation with auto-detected tech stack
- - GitHub Actions workflows for @claude automation
- - CI/CD template setup based on detected build tools
- - Consistent project structure across repositories
- - Immediate agent collaboration capability via @claude mentions

### Timeboxing And Completion

#### Philosophy

- Balance between "good enough" and "perfect now" - lean toward "perfect now because we might as well"
- NEVER arbitrarily ignore issues just to be done ("I've had enough, I quit")
- NEVER solve problems by "not caring" - address root causes
- If something is worth doing, do it right - shortcuts often create more work later
- Timeboxing is for exploration/research, not for cutting corners on known issues

#### When To Timebox

- Exploratory work: "Let's try this approach for 30 minutes"
- Research/investigation: "Spend an hour understanding this library"
- Experiments: "Quick proof-of-concept to validate approach"

#### When Not To Timebox

- Fixing known bugs - fix them properly
- Addressing test failures - make tests pass
- Resolving linting errors - clean code is non-negotiable
- Security issues - never postpone or ignore
